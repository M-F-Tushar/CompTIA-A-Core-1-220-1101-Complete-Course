# 📚 Cable Types and Their Uses 🖥️

## Introduction
In this section, we'll cover the various cable types you’ll use to connect devices to your workstation, both internally and externally. A computer is made up of many components connected by different cables and connectors. Let's dive into the details! 🌟

## Understanding Data and Transfer Rates 📊
Computers measure storage and data transfer rates in bits and bytes:
- **Bit**: A binary digit storing one of two values, 0 or 1.
- **Byte**: Consists of 8 bits.
- **Notation**:
  - 50 bits = 50b (lowercase b for bits)
  - 50 bits transferred in 2 seconds = 25 bits per second (bps)

### Multiples of Bits and Bytes
- **Kilobit (Kb)**: 1,000 bits
- **Kilobyte (KB)**: 1,000 bytes
- **Megabit (Mb)**: 1,000,000 bits
- **Megabyte (MB)**: 1,000,000 bytes
- **Gigabit (Gb)**: 1,000,000,000 bits
- **Gigabyte (GB)**: 1,000,000,000 bytes
- **Terabit (Tb)**: 1,000,000,000,000 bits
- **Terabyte (TB)**: 1,000,000,000,000 bytes

## Example: Understanding Speeds
- **1 gigabit per second (Gbps)**: Lowercase b
- **250 gigabytes per second (GBps)**: Uppercase B, 8 times larger than bits
  - 250 GBps = 2,000 Gbps

## Domain Focus: Hardware 🔧
We’ll focus on Domain 3, Hardware, covering cable types, their connectors, features, and purposes.

## Key Exam Objective: Explain 📘
Understand the meaning of information and answer questions based on what you've learned. Example question: "Which version of USB can operate at speeds up to 5 gigabits per second?"

## Typical Desktop Computer Ports and Connectors 🖥️
- **External Ports**: USB, HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, VGA, Thunderbolt
- **Internal Cables**: SATA, eSATA, IDE/PATA, SCSI, Lightning, Serial, Molex

## USB Cable Types 🔌
- **USB Versions**: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 4.0
- **USB Connectors**: Type A, Type B, Mini USB, Micro USB, USB-C

## Video Cables 📺
- **HDMI**
- **DisplayPort**
- **DVI**
- **VGA**
- **Thunderbolt**

## Data Transfer and Storage Cables 💽
- **SATA**
- **eSATA**
- **IDE/PATA**
- **SCSI**
- **Lightning**
- **Serial**
- **Molex**

## Conclusion
As you prepare for the exam, remember to explain the basic cable types, their connectors, features, and purposes. Write down or highlight speeds, distances, and purposes for each cable type in your notes for memorization. Let's begin our journey into understanding cable types! 🚀
