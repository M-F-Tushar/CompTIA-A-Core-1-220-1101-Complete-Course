# 🛠️ Safety Procedures for Technicians 🦺

## Introduction
In this lesson, we're going to talk about some safety procedures that you should be aware of as you begin working as a technician. If you're following along in this course and want to try building your own custom personal computer, it's essential to consider your personal safety as you perform different actions. Let's dive into the four main areas of safety: personal safety, component safety, electrical safety, and chemical safety. 🌟

## Personal Safety 👷‍♂️
### Avoiding Trip Hazards 🚶‍♂️
Avoiding trip hazards is crucial for your safety and the safety of your coworkers. Run cables through drop ceilings, underneath raised floors, or use cable runways to prevent people from tripping over them. Always clean up after yourself to ensure pathways are clear.

### Proper Lifting Techniques 🏋️‍♂️
When lifting heavy or bulky objects, always lift with your legs, not your back. Bend your knees to lower yourself and grab the object. If the object is too large or heavy, ask a coworker to help or use a push cart. For objects over 40 to 50 pounds, consider it a two-person or team lift.

### Safety Gear 🥽
Use safety goggles, gloves, and masks when working with chemical compounds or cleaning equipment. Safety goggles protect your eyes, gloves prevent chemicals from getting on your skin, and masks ensure you don't breathe in harmful substances.

## Component Safety 🖥️
### Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) ⚡
Electrostatic discharge can damage components. Carry components in antistatic bags and wear an ESD wrist strap to discharge static electricity from your body into a ground. Use an ESD mat when handling and installing components to prevent ESD damage.

## Electrical Safety 🔌
### Preventing Electrocution ⚠️
Always unplug the computer before working inside its case. Shut down the computer, unplug the power cord, and then proceed with your work. Ensure your equipment is properly grounded and plugged into a surge protector to prevent damage during high voltage events.

## Chemical Safety ☣️
### Handling Hazardous Materials 🧪
As a technician, you'll encounter hazardous materials like lithium batteries, toner, and components containing lead, mercury, or arsenic. Wear protective gear and know how to properly handle and dispose of hazardous materials. Refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for information on ingredients, health hazards, precautions, and first aid for each chemical or hazardous material.

## Conclusion 🌟
Remember to follow the proper safety precautions to prevent injury to yourself, others, and your equipment. Keep personal safety, component safety, electrical safety, and chemical safety in mind as you work with computers and components. Stay safe and happy building! 😊
